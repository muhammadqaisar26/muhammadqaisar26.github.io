        <h2>SEO Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            Meta tags is a very effective SEO technique. This can be in the form of a meta description, which provides search engines with a brief overview of the content contained on a webpage. This helps encourage users to visit a site through improoving the webpage's visibility. I used a meta description in all my webpages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another effective SEO technique is using heading tags that are structured (e.g., <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>). These tags improve readability of a web page and makes it far easier to be recognized by search engine crawlers properly.
        </p>
        <p>
            One other technique is to have alt image for text. Alt text as implemented in previous labs, makes content more accessible. It involves adding text to explain the content of images and makes a web-page more visible to image searching engines. I implemented this technique wherever I had images on my website.

        <h2>SMO Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            An effective SMO technique is the addition of the Facebook Like Button to a webpage. It allows users to share content with their social networks providing a unique way to interact with a webpage. This increases a websites reach exponentially.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using icons for social media is also an effective SMO technique. This increases brand awareness and brings in a lot of traffic to a website as users are more easily able to share content on multiple different platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Integrating a social media link is also effective as an SMO technique. By driving users to a company's social media page, businesses can connect with a larger audience therefore increasing engangement.
